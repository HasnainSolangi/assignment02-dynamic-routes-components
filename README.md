# Task 2: Building a Next.js Application with Dynamic Routes using Component

**Description:**

In this task, the objective was to enhance the previously developed application by modularizing the country detail display into a reusable component. A new `CountryCard` component was created to encapsulate the rendering of country information, promoting better code organization and reusability. The dynamic country pages were updated to utilize this component, allowing for a cleaner and more maintainable codebase. Each country's details are now displayed in a structured card format, improving the visual presentation of the information.

**Key Features:**
- Introduction of a `CountryCard` component to display country details.
- Modular design for improved code maintainability.
- Dynamic rendering of country information through props, enhancing reusability.
